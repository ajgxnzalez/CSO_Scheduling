# How to Run

The code will prompt the user to enter the number of processes. Follow the prompt and do not include any extraneous spaces. Following will be a prompt asking to enter either `1` or `2` where 1 corresponds to simulating FIFO and 2 simulating RR processing. Choose accordingly. If Round Robin scheduling is chosen, the user will be prompted to enter a quantum value, which should be entered with no extraneous spaces. Finally, the user will be prompted to enter the `R1`, `B1`, `R2`, and `B2` values for each process one at a time. Enter the four values for each, with a space in between each value. For example:

__OUTPUT__
Enter the R1, B1, R2, B2 values for processes 1:

__INPUT__
3 2 3 2

^^ The above still will continue for the number of proccess that the user wishes to run, with each prompt asking for the subsequent processes' R and B values.
